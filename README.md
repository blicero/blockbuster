Blockbuster is an application to keep track of a collection of video
files.

Read the full, ugly truth in the [org-mode file](blockbuster.org),
because emacs is the truth. (If you are a heretic, though, I am told
Microsoft's Visual Studio Code has an add-on for org-mode files, and
allegedly there is an app for Android, too.)
